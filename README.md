- âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was... an actual bug! ðŸª²
Back in 1947, computer pioneer Grace Hopper and her team were working on the Harvard Mark II computer. One day, it started malfunctioning. They opened it up and â€” no joke â€” found a moth stuck inside one of the relays. ðŸ¦‹âš¡

They literally "debugged" the machine by removing the moth. The team even taped the dead moth into their logbook with the note:

"First actual case of bug being found."

ðŸ““ That logbook is still in the Smithsonian. And that, is why we call software problems bugs today.
